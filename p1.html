Big data is a term used for data sets whose size or type extends beyond the capability of traditional relational databases to capture, manage and process low latency data.<br> Big data has one or more features: high volume, high velocity or high variety.<br> Data sophistication is powered by artificial intelligence ( AI), web, social and the Internet of Things ( IoT).Drives data complexity by means of new forms and data sources.<br> Big data, for instance, comes from sensors , devices, video / audio, networks, log files, transactional apps, web , and social media â€” much of it is generated in real time and on a very large scale.<br>
Big-data analysis helps analysts, researchers and business users to make smarter and quicker decisions using previously unavailable or unusable data.<br> Businesses can use advanced analytical techniques such as text analysis, machine learning, predictive analysis , data mining, statistics and the processing of natural languages to gain new insights from previously untapped data sources independently or together with existing enterprise data<br>
Big data analytics is the use of advanced analytical techniques against very large , diverse data sets that include structured, semi-structured and unstructured data from different sources, from terabytes to zetta bytes, in different sizes
